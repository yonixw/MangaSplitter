# MangaSplitterReorder and split manga images to the target binding.Please note that out method only cut printing by half because 2-side printing still cost for each side and not by papers used (in most print outlets)## Version 1- Changes image source files- Split double pages --> Little space in the middle when printing (called gutter)- Does not make pdf at the end- Booklet does not have split optionVersion 1 screenshot :![Print screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yonixw/MangaSplitter/master/printscreen.png "Print screen")You can use the dll of the algorithm with your own program. Example:```javascript MainAlgo algo = new MainAlgo(new MainAlgoConfig()                {                    Booklet = radBooklet.Checked,                    rtl = radRTL.Checked,                    doublePageMinWidthPx = (int)numericUpDown1.Value,                    sourchDirPath = lblPath.Text,                    targetDirPath = lblTarget.Text,                    sourceSubdirsInclude = cbSubfolders.Checked,                    jsCodeHelper = rtbJS.Text                });                algo.StartSplitting();```## Version 2 (In the future)- More robust algorithm (not odd\even but some OO)- Double pages stay together (single are joined)- Make pdf on the go with some opensource library and don't change source files- Let user inspect result in some form of a GUI- Let user split booklet (meaning we calculate booklet and not printer)- Add page numbers and border and direction arrow	- We need to make landscape templates (single, double) and embed zoomed pages in them
